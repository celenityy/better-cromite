# better-cromite

My recommendations for the ultimate configuration of the [Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) Browser :)

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-cromite), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/better-cromite).

# Additional recommendations

* Use a (reputable) VPN. I would recommend either [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).

* Use a (reputable) anti-virus if possible, such as [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/). **NOTE:** You should install Hypatia through the [DivestOS Official Repo](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/?fingerprint=E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467) instead of F-Droid's main repo, as it will allow you to receive quicker updates directly from the developer. It's also recommended to use [F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic/) as your F-Droid client of choice.
